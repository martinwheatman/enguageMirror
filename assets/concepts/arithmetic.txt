## Simple calculation
     On "calculate PHRASE-X", perform "numeric evaluate X".
Then on "calculate PHRASE-X", if not, reply "i did not get that".

## Typical description
     On "what is NUMERIC-PHRASE-X", perform "numeric evaluate X".
Then on "what is NUMERIC-PHRASE-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL ...".
Then on "what is NUMERIC-PHRASE-X", reply "X is ...".
Then on "what is NUMERIC-PHRASE-X", if not, reply "i did not get that".
     On "help", reply "to calculate a numeric phrase".

## Running total...
     On "NUMERIC-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL X".
    
     On "+ NUMERIC-X", perform "numeric evaluate SUBTOTAL plus X".
Then on "+ NUMERIC-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL ...".
Then on "+ NUMERIC-X", reply "plus X makes SUBTOTAL".

     On "add NUMERIC-X", + X.
     On "help", reply "and so on, to keep a running total".
     
##
     On "minus NUMERIC-X", perform "numeric evaluate SUBTOTAL minus X".
Then on "minus NUMERIC-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL ...".
Then on "minus NUMERIC-X", reply "minus X makes SUBTOTAL".
    
     On "take away NUMERIC-X", minus X.
    
##
     On "times NUMERIC-X", perform "numeric evaluate SUBTOTAL times X".
Then on "times NUMERIC-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL ...".
Then on "times NUMERIC-X", reply "times X makes SUBTOTAL".
    
     On "times by      NUMERIC-X", times X.
Then on "times by      NUMERIC-X", reply "times by X makes SUBTOTAL".

     On "multiplied by NUMERIC-X", times X.
Then on "multiplied by NUMERIC-X", reply "multiplied by X makes SUBTOTAL".
    
     On "equals", reply "SUBTOTAL".

##
     On "divided by NUMERIC-X", perform "numeric evaluate SUBTOTAL divided by X".
Then on "divided by NUMERIC-X", perform "variable set $SUBTOTAL ...".
Then on "divided by NUMERIC-X", reply "divided by X makes SUBTOTAL".
